# Sobriety Detection

This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques, particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision, to detect intoxicated individuals and address challenges associated with substance abuse. 

**Key Objectives:**

* **Intoxication Detection:** 
    * Employ NLP algorithms to analyze text data (conversations) and identify patterns indicative of intoxication.
    * Utilize OpenCV and Deep Learning for facial recognition and analysis to detect signs of intoxication.
* **Age Estimation:**
    * Estimate the age of individuals to identify instances of underage substance abuse.
* **User-Friendly Interface:**
    * Develop a web interface using HTML, CSS, React, and Flask for user interaction.

**Technologies:**

* **Python**
* **OpenCV**
* **NLP Libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)**
* **React**
* **HTML**
* **CSS**
* **Flask**

**Project Approach:**

* **NLP:** Analyze text data (conversations) to identify patterns associated with intoxication.
* **Computer Vision:**
    * Utilize OpenCV for facial recognition and analysis.
    * Employ Deep Learning for accurate face detection and age estimation.
* **Web Development:**
    * Build a user-friendly web interface using HTML, CSS, React, and Flask for user interaction.

**Team Roles:**

* **Shreeya Pandey:**
    * Focus on NLP for speech and text recognition of intoxicated individuals.
    * Study patterns of individual reactions based on age.
    * Contribute to research and development.
    * Work on the frontend of the web interface.
* **Hillol Borah:**
    * Work with OpenCV libraries for facial recognition and age estimation.
    * Train machine learning models for intoxication detection.
    * Develop the backend of the web interface for real-time updates.

**Note:** This is a basic framework. You can further enhance this README.md file by:

* Adding specific details about the NLP algorithms and machine learning models used.
* Including a project timeline or roadmap.
* Adding a section on ethical considerations and data privacy.
* Incorporating visuals like diagrams or flowcharts to illustrate the project's architecture.
